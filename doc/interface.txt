Possible interfaces:

- Fully qualified function name (Text::Lossy::filtername)
- Prefixed name for export (lossy_filtername)
- OO interface (Text::Lossy->new->filtername(1)->filter);

- in-place, single value, multiple values

Go with the OO interface only, as above. new() mandatory.

Programmatic access with add_filter.
(And possibly push_filter, pop_filter, shift_filter, unshift_filter)

More programmatic access with register_filter.
Registered filters become callable function names.
Most likely via AUTOLOAD instead of globbing; makes for nicer
error reports.
